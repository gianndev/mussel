# Mussel Tutorial

Consider this file as a tutorial that explains how the **Mussel programming language** works.

## Data types

Mussel supports the following basic data types:

- **Strings**: only supported between double quotes `"`
- **Integers**: both positive and nevative numbers are supported
- **Float numbers**: they use the dot `.` to separate the whole part from the decimal part in numbers (like `3.14`)
- **Booleans**: they are basically only `true` and `false` (both must be lowercase)
- **Arrays**: a list of values stored between square brackets and separated by a `,` (like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`)

## Variables
Mussel uses the keyword `let` to define a variable, using as logic the name of the variable, then `=` and then the value of the variable

```
let name = "John"
let age = 45
let is_male = true
```

⚠️ *There is no need to manually specify the data type and no need to put a `;` at the end of each line: Mussel is smart enough to understand everything by itself*

## println() function
To print somethin on screen, like the content of a variable, you can use the `println()` function

```
let greet = "Hello dude!"
println(greet)
```

## Conditionals: *if* and *else*
Conditionals are represented by the keywords `if` and `else`, followed by the condition and then curly braces are needed to contain the part of the code that is executed if the condition is met

⚠️ *There is no support for a command like `else if` yet, so there are only two possible values that can stay in the same condition*

The Mussel language supports the following comparison operators:

| Operator     | Meaning              |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **`==`**     | Is equal to          |
| **`!=`**     | Is not equal to      |
| **`<`**      | Less than            |
| **`>`**      | Greater than         |
| **`<=`**     | Less than or equal   |
| **`>=`**     | Greater than or equal|

Below there is an example of Mussel code that uses everything we have seen until now:

```
let number = -29

if number > 0 {
    println("{number} is positive.")
} else {
    if number < 0 {
        println("{number} is negative.")
    } else {
        println("The number is zero.")
    }
}
```

## *for* loop
The for loop iterates over an array. For each item in the array, it binds the item to a variable and evaluates the loop body.

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers {
    println(num)
}
```

## Arrays
Arrays are defined with square brackets and elements separated by commas. You can access elements using the Get expression (using square brackets after a variable name).

⚠️ *Like most of programming languges out there, in Mussel the first element of the array has position 0, and the second element has the position number 1*

```
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
println(fruits[1])
```

## String Interpolation
Mussel supports interpolation inside string literals. When a string contains curly braces {...}, the interpreter attempts to parse and evaluate the expression inside the braces, then inserts the result into the string.

```
let name = "Alice"
println("Hello, {name}!")
```

## Functions
Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword. A function includes a name, parameters, and a body wrapped in curly braces. Function calls pass arguments within parentheses.

Example of function definition:

```
fn add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

let result = add(5, 7)
println(result)
```

*Note: In Mussel, functions are stored as closures in the interpreter's context, allowing for simple first-class function support.*

## Comments
To add a comment in Mussel code, use `//` for inline comments.

```
// This is a comment
println("Hello") // prints a string
```

⚠️ *Multiline comments are not supported yet, but you can use `//` for multiple lines if necessary*
