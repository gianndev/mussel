# Contributing to Mussel

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to Mussel! Contributions of all kinds are welcome — whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion, code improvement, or documentation fix.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** locally.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes.  

   > 📝 **Recommended:** Name your branch after your first or last name (e.g. `john`, `smith`, or `alex-feature`).

3. Make your changes and commit on your new branch.

4. **Open a Pull Request** to the main repository with a clear description of what you've changed or added.

## Code Style

- Try to keep your code clean and well-documented.
- Add comments where the logic may not be immediately obvious.

## Communication

- Feel free to open an issue if you're unsure about something or want to discuss a new feature idea before starting work on it.
- Pull requests will be reviewed, and you may be asked to make changes — nothing personal! We just want to keep the codebase solid and maintainable.

Thanks again for contributing — you're awesome! 🚀
